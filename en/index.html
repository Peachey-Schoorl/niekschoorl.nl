        <h2>In Memoriam</h2>
        <p>
            As a person, Niek was a multicolored mosaic; a person with many faces. He was sweet and sensitive, a striking figure and an enthusiastic bon vivant, but he was also anarchic and unfathomable. He had strong morals but was also an opportunist. He was someone who easily combined his ideological affinity with the leprechaun movement with the proud ownership of a jaguar XK8 and his love of nature and the planet went hand in hand with his fondness for the latest gadgets from Silicon Valley. These extremes were characteristic of him. On the one hand he was an imaginative dreamer and on the other he was standing with both sandals on the floor. Niek was difficult to characterize because he valued his own autonomy above all else.
        </p>
        <p>
            Niek never had a lack of plans.
            Where others saw problems, he mainly saw opportunities and possibilities.
            When a problem presented itself, he withdrew to deliberate on it for a while and to 'hmm'
            and then come up with practical and elegant solutions.
            He used to think with his hands and that is how he shaped his own life and the world around him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Niek was a explorer and an adventurer. Nothing unfamiliar scared him off. Every week there was a new plan for a distant journey, a new hobby or a new career, which he always threw himself into with (sometimes rash) complete surrender. Niek has traveled a lot to Cambodia and Thailand, where he felt an affinity with the culture, but when making long journeys became physically more challenging in recent years, he set out with a small bus-camper in the Netherlands and Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            On an adventure with the camper in Luxembourg and still full of plans, Niek passed away in his sleep on the night of July 24.
